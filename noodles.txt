Steps:

Add baked soda and salt to the water, dissolve completely. I like to add one at a time, it seems like the baked soda dissolves better if added prior to the salt.

In the food processor, add your wheat gluten and flour. Pulse a few times to combine the two.

While running the food processor, add your water mixture slowly, in an even stream. Occasionally, stop to scrape the sides down. You know you're set when you have tiny grain like pieces.

Cover the food processor and let this rest for 30 minutes. This gives the flour granules time to fully absorb the water and alkaline salts.

Knead it. I used to throw the mix into a plastic bag and step on it repeatedly, which simulates the kneading process used in an industrial setting. Currently I use an electric pasta machine to sheet the dough, going through the largest setting, then the 2nd, then the 3rd, then folding and repassing through the largest setting. I repass two to three times, or until I notice the dough is making the machine work really hard. I also like to fold the dough the same direction each time. Some articles I read suggested this kept the gluten strands running in the same direction, which promotes better texture. You'll notice interesting horizontal lines running along the length of your dough if you do it right.

When smooth, cover with plastic, and rest at room temp for an hour. This gives the gluten time to relax, and “ripens” the dough.

Pull out your dough. Portion into workable sizes (around one serving's worth), and roll out to desired thickness, using potato starch as you go to prevent sticking. Do this with a pasta machine, it is borderline impossible without a machine. An electric one will save you an incredible amount of effort.

Cut your noodles to your desired thickness. I like mine rather thin for tonkotsu, but you rule your ramen.

Store for up to 2 days in the fridge, or indefinitely in the freezer.
