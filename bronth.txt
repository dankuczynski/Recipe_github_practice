Steps:

Before any cooking, soak the bones in cold water in a large, non-reactive vessel, for at least 6 hours, and up to 24 hours. (I use a large plastic container).

The night before you want your broth ready, drain the bones, add them to a pot with fresh water covering them by 2 inches, and bring to a boil over high heat.

Drop the heat to medium, and blanch the bones, at a simmer, for 15-30 minutes, or until little to no scum rises.

Strain the bones again, and scrub away any black material, such as coagulated blood, from the bones and pot.

Return the bones to the pot. Add fresh water, and add in the fatback. If doing the night before, bring this to a boil, then down to the lowest setting on your stove, and cover. Then go to bed. If not, continue to step 7.

In the morning, bring the pot back up to a full boil, then back down to the lowest setting possible to mantain that jostling boil while covered. (For me, this is medium on my stove)

Depending on when you started cooking, continue to boil the broth for 12-18 hours, or until desired consistency and color is reached, meat has completely separated and broken down in the broth, and fatback pieces have mostly melted. Optionally, you can stir every 1-2 hours just to check up on things and promote more churning. Please feel free to add back water if the level gets too low.

Once cooked to your liking, strain the broth, discarding the solids, and reserve broth until needed over low heat. This broth keeps for around a week in the fridge.

After you done with everything make sure you test it.
